# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

  On a scale of 1-5. 5 being fully confident, I am at a 4. I know I have so much to learn about everything you can do in an each method but after the small group lesson, I feel like I can better conceptualize how to use a method, conditional, etc. within an each method.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

  I am glad that I went over the lesson ahead of class. I needed to both read and hear the lesson being taught. When I was going over the lesson ahead of time, I was struggling but it was all productive. It felt both uncomfortable and rewarding to learn a more advanced concept. As I was deep in the lesson, I got a little bit of tunnel vision and really had to think hard about my background knowledge. For example, using string interpolation, if statements, and conditional statements within a code block.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

  I would like to spend some time doing challenges like we did in the iteration lesson over and over again. Each time I am able to successfully write out the code block, I retain what I have learned just a little bit more. I have added this to my 'to-do' list for the time between mod 0 and mod 1.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

  I don't have any additional questions at this time. The questions I had while reviewing the lesson ahead of time were answered during the small group session.
